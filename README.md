## Hello!

Hi! I'm Lilian Nicolau, an English teacher from Brazil who decided to venture in the world of programming at 37.👩‍💻  What a great decision I have made! 

## My story (made short)

My story with programming begins when I felt that Education was not fulfilling me anymore. I have the feeling that I had done all it could be done as a teacher and as a school coordinator and there was nowhere else for me to go. Also, I believe it is OK for people to give them a chance of doing something new, something they have never done before, specially in the current situation we live in, in which businesses are having to reinvent themselves. If the market changes, we need to change. 
So, in September 2020 I started my studies to become a full-stack web developer in an Educational start-up called Labenu. There I learned skills to start in the business as a junior developer. You can see some projects I developed by taking a look at my public repository.
